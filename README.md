Laravel Authentication Portal
Overview
This project is a simple authentication portal built with Laravel. The portal allows users to register, log in, and log out, with public and member-only pages protected by multi-guard authentication. The authentication is handled using Laravel’s session-based authentication system, configured to work with a custom accounts table in MySQL.

Features
Account Registration: Users can register with their email and password.
Login & Logout: Users can log in with their registered credentials and log out securely.
Public & Member-Only Pages: Public pages are accessible to all, while member-only pages are restricted to authenticated users.
Multi-Guard Authentication: Separate authentication guard for accounts, isolated from Laravel's default users guard.

Multi-Guard Authentication Setup
This project utilizes Laravel's multi-guard authentication feature to handle separate user sessions. Here's how it works:

Guards: The account guard is configured in config/auth.php to manage authentication for the accounts table.
Middleware: A custom middleware, EnsureAccountIsAuthenticated, protects routes meant only for authenticated accounts.
Controllers: The AccountAuthController handles registration, login, and logout operations for the account guard.
Testing the Application
To test the functionality:

Register a New Account: Visit /register, enter an email and password, and submit the form.
Log In: Visit /login, enter your registered credentials, and log in.
Access Member-Only Page: After logging in, visit /member to see a page accessible only to authenticated users.
Log Out: Click the logout button to end the session.
Git Commit Guidelines
The codebase follows strict Git commit guidelines to maintain clean and understandable version history:

Semantic Prefixes: Commits use prefixes like feat, fix, chore, etc.
Imperative and Lowercase: Commit messages are written in imperative and lowercase form.
Atomic Commits: Each commit is atomic, addressing a single piece of functionality or fix.
Example commit messages:

feat: add form to user login page
fix: validate email before form submission
chore: update .gitignore
